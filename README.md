Digit Co. was set up by, the then 29 year old, Edward Bloch, in 2013, in San Francisco, USA, with the key "financial" purpose of analysing a user's spending and earning habits and automatically saving money for them. Initial investors included Google Ventures and Baseline Ventures.

 **It is estimated that Digit Co. has saved over US$1 billion so far for its customers.** *[Fastcompany](https://www.fastcompany.com/40533914/digit-with-1-billion-saved-turns-attention-to-consumer-debt)*

### Business Activities <a name="subparagraph2"></a>

Digit's financial purpose is to:
 > improve the financial health of everyone.

 Digit has taken advantage of the phenomenal improvements in technology to help people automatically manage their personal finances by providing its users a "smart financial assistant".

 It evaluates the individual's spending habits to determine the savings that can be transferred in small amounts to a linked Digit savings account. These savings are then utilised towards targeted spends or investments.
 
  As staed by *[PTMoney](https://ptmoney.com/digit-review/):*
 > "This micro-savings app can help people achieve financial goals while running quietly in the background of their financial life."


### Product Offering <a name="subparagraph3"></a>

- Digit is a subscription based model and is accessible via mobile application or website.
- Its focus areas are Consumer Savings and Investing.
- It has developed an algorithm to monitor and understand a subscriber's earning and spending pattern to calculate small amounts of savings without impacting the users.
- There is no minimum investment required.
- It offers an automated saving application that allows individuals to save small amounts at a time.
- It provides a Budgeting application that customers can control and use to set up Savings and Goals.
- Using AI, it matches users with a diversified portfolio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the user’s risk tolerance and investing goals.(This explains the phenomenal growth in ETFs in recent times).
- Digit also offers the ability to save for retirement per US regulations.


### Target Customers <a name="subparagraph4"></a>

Key factors that have influenced Digit's target customer base are:
- Today's technological advances that have led to the growth of 'frictionless spending' i.e. making spending too easy and seamless. Digit uses technology to offer 'frictionless savings'.
- The generational change in customer profile (aka millennials) majorly impacting the pace of adoption of new technological solutions.
- The significant impact of Covid 19 on our "way" of life.

Based on the above, the current target customers of Digit are:
1. Individuals who find it difficult to manage their money. 
2. Millennials who like automated technology to manage their personal finances. 

The potential target audience for Digit is global, across all countries and age segments i.e. youth who need to save and invest to manage student loans, housing, etc. and the older generation who need to manage savings and investments for their retirement.

 
### Technologies in Play <a name="subparagraph5"></a>
 - To achieve its business purpose, research suggests that Digit uses the following technologies:
 1. Banking APIs- Digit's partner banks are Chase, Wells Fargo, BBVA, Luther Burbank, Bank of America and Axos. Digit accesses, in real time, customer bank and credit card transactions. (Digit uses Heroku, a Cloud Application Platform for databases and to build applications and APIs).
 2. Machine Learning with Behavioural Psychology to analyse transactions to assist in deployment of financial strategies.
 3. Mobile and web applications and the constant improvement in their capabilities/ access/security. (Digit uses Zendesk to manage customer interactions/Sectigo and Okta to manage customer identity security management).
 4. Low cost communications technology.
 5. Cloud offering that allows for scaling of operations.(Digit uses Cloudflare).


### Competitors <a name="subparagraph6"></a>

The FinTech domain of Personal Finance is growing very rapidly and is attracting new players each day. Listed below are some of Digit's competitors:
Company|Product Offering|Geography|Est.Value|
-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Chime|Allows individuals to round up purchases and automatically invest the change|US and Canada|USD14.5B|
|Tink|Mobile app that provides insight to the financial habits by integrating banking and credit card transactions|Scandinavian countries|Acquired by Visa for EU1.8B in June 2021|

|Betterment|Robo investment advisory services|US|USD800M|
|Mint|Allows users to track bank, credit card, investment, and loan balances through a single user interface as well as create budgets and set financial goals|US and Canada|Acquired by Intuit|

The surge in the number of digital banks who also offer budgeting, savings and investment products will impact Digit in the years to come e.g. *[Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-AU)*.

### Results <a name="subparagraph7"></a>

As mentioned earlier, Digit has saved its customers over US$1 Billion so far, enabling many of its customers to achieve their personal financial goals. 

This has been possible due to Digit's solution:
- Removing, by use of AI, any bias involved in financial decisions by objectively analysing the individual's finances and automatically choosing the best option for the individual.
- Allowing individuals to save small amounts making savings a habit and easier for individuals to reach targeted financial goals.
- Providing a mobile application that offers simple and easy to use experience for consumers.
- Automating all tasks thereby doing away with the manual work of collating data which most individuals avoid.
- Using modern technological solutions to make its customers day to day living simpler.


## Domain Landscape and Company Performance <a name="paragraph3"></a>

Personal Finance FinTech is still a nascent industry with most startups predominantly operating in the North American market as depicted in the "Competitors" section in this case study. Also refer *[Digit's competitors.](https://craft.co/digitco/competitors)*

__*Summary- Digit Co. Performance:*__

Digit, as evidenced in this case study and summarised below, can be said to be successful in the domain of Personal Finance. 

- It has been listed in  Forbes 2021 top 50 Fintech companies.
- It has received in excess of US$250M in funding so far from major venture capital funds. 
- In 2019, it was valued at approx. US$500M. *[Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/digit-4)*.
- Last but not the least, its product meets its stated financial purpose of encouraging micro savings- it has saved over US$1 Billion so far for its customers.


## Trends

In the last few years, this domain has seen rapid changes with European companies such as Numbrs (DE), Bankin’ (FR) and Money Dashboard (UK) offering more or less similar services.

The growth of Digital banking, Open Banking, Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence will accelerate the Personal Finance products that will be introduced in the years ahead.

The process of digitalisation of financial transactions has also been steeply accelerated by Covid 19. Social distancing and lockdowns have forced the young and the old, globally, down the digital path making the growth in Personal Finance applications a "given".

Per John Ellmore, Director of KnowYourMoney.co.uk states that consequent to the impact of Covid 19 in UK:
>* '57% of consumers now prefer to use online banking tools to manage their finances'*

Based on the above, the key areas in the domain of Personal Finance that are expected to grow per *[finance-monthly.com](https://www.finance-monthly.com)* are:

__1. Digital Banking__

More and more consumers will look for user friendly apps which will make banking transactions simpler, speedier and more transparent.

__2. Personalised Financial Experience__

In tomorrow's digital world, Robo advisors will make it plausible to offer tailored financial advice to suit each individual. This technology will not only make financial decision making simpler but also offer the speed of delivery.

__3. Comparison Websites__

Today's consumers would like to receive the best product offering for which they are relying extensively on comparison websites. These websites strive to provide the best comparative information possible by using AI algorithms to rate and rank the offerings.

Per *[mindk.com](mindk.com/blog/fintech-trends-2021)*, the areas that will see growth are:

__1. Open Banking__

This is the key to the services offered by FinTech companies operating in the domain of Personal Finance. This allows non banking organisations to access real time banking data so that these organisations can offer a variety of non banking services to consumers.

__2. Embedded Finance__

Embedded Finance will allow a consumer to access any financial service via a mobile, web application from any non banking organisation. The Embedded Financial Service Provider will be a bridge between financial institutions and non banking organisations. Examples of this service are: Afterpay, Klarna. 


## Recommendations <a name="paragraph4"></a>

To remain relevant, I believe, Digit Co. will need to:

__1. Broaden its Operations__

Since Digit addresses the global issue of micro savings, it should scale up its offering to other countries.

__2. Broaden its Product Offering__

New entrants, like SoFi Money, are mimicking aspects of Digit’s offering and bundling automated saving into broader financial offerings. To survive, Digit will have to follow suit and introduce new features e.g. money management features such as reporting,  analytics of spending, net worth tracking, greater personalisation.

__3. Cater for Banking Transactions__

Digit currently does not allow withdrawals and deposits, though Digit has announced the setting up of a digital bank, Direct.

__4. Broaden its Customer Base__

Set up potential tie ups with Governments, Banks and Financial Planners to provide the product to their customers e.g. welfare recipients, account holders, etc.

To achieve the above, Digit will require to:
- continue to scale up its cloud platforms and applications.
- introduce multilingual applications so that it can operate globally.
- develop tailored algorithms specific to a user in a particular country using machine learning with input from other non technical areas (Psychology, Economics, Statistics, Country specific social cultures and norms).
- collaborate with other organisations offering Embedded Financial products.
