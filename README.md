n the US there are obviously products such as Mint and Level Money. In Europe we see the companies such as Numbrs (DE), Bankin’ (FR) and Money Dashboard (UK) offering more or less similar services to Tink. We believe we have a strong advantage by creating a fully automated mobile product where everything is presented in a feed format which makes it useful even if you have only have 2 minutes to spar
Ever wonder how much you spend each month on Uber? The newly released Trim chatbot will tell you in a text.

Trim also helps you manage subscriptions, set up spending alerts and check your bank balance. But there is no app, only a bot that can be linked to SMS or Facebook.

“Anything that you can do on your mobile banking app, you can do with trim with the exception of moving money,” said CEO and co-founder Thomas Smyth. He founded the business alongside fellow Yale alumni Daniel Petkevich and the duo is based in San Francisco.

Launched in September in Sweden last year, and available for iOS and Android, Tink’s mobile app lets you keep a handle on your personal finances, by linking the app to banks accounts and credit cards. Targeting the young and mobile, specifically, it presents insights into spending habits via a news-feed style stream in a bid to make it, well, fun, as well as productive.

Although the app includes paying down debt as a topic within savings, the app maintains its focus. There are no features designed for money management, reporting or analytics of spending or net worth tracking.

If you’re looking for a budgeting app solely focused on saving money, paying down debt and investing concurrently, Digit is a great budgeting app to consider. With a modest price point of $5 per month, the app may be worth it to some to take away the chore of manually saving each month and making investment decisions.
